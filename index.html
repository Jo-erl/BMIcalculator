      <h3>What is Body Mass Index (BMI)?</h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BMI is a measure that evaluates an individual's
        body composition by
        considering their weight and height. Its purpose is to provide an
        estimation of tissue mass and determine if a person has a suitable body
        weight relative to their height. The calculated BMI value is used to
        classify individuals into categories such as underweight, normal weight,
        overweight, or obese, based on predetermined ranges.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These ranges can
        vary depending on factors like geographical region and age, and may
        include subcategories like severely underweight or very severely obese.
        It's important to note that being underweight or overweight can have
        significant impacts on health. Although BMI is not a perfect measure of
        healthy body weight, it serves as a valuable indicator to determine if
        further assessment or actions are necessary.

      <h3>Risks associated with being underweight</h3>
      <p>
        According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), being
        underweight can be associated with several health risks. Some of the
        risks include:<br><br>

        <b>Nutritional deficiencies:</b> Underweight individuals may not be
        consuming enough essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, which can
        lead to deficiencies and weaken the immune system.<br><br>

        <b>Weakened immune system:</b> Insufficient body weight can compromise
        the immune system, making underweight individuals more susceptible to
        infections, illnesses, and delayed healing.<br><br>

        <b>Malnutrition:</b> Underweight individuals may experience
        malnutrition, which can negatively impact overall health, growth, and
        development.<br><br>

        <b>Reduced muscle mass and strength:</b> Inadequate body weight can
        result in loss of muscle mass and strength, leading to reduced physical
        performance and increased risk of injuries.<br><br>

        <b>Hormonal imbalances:</b> Being underweight can disrupt hormonal
        balance in the body, affecting reproductive health and leading to
        irregular menstrual cycles in women.<br><br>

        <b>Increased risk of osteoporosis:</b> Insufficient body weight can
        contribute to lower bone density, increasing the risk of developing
        osteoporosis and fractures later in life.<br><br>

        <b>Impaired growth and development:</b> In children and adolescents,
        being underweight can hinder proper growth and development, affecting
        physical, cognitive, and emotional well-being.<br><br>

        <p><i style="color: rgb(59, 59, 59);">It's important to note that the
            specific risks associated with being underweight may vary depending
            on individual circumstances and underlying health conditions. It is
            advisable to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized
            guidance and support if you have concerns about being
            underweight.</i>

      <h3>Risks associated with being overweight</h3>
      <p>
        According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there
        are several health risks associated with being overweight. These risks
        include:<br><br>

        <b>Cardiovascular diseases:</b> Being overweight increases the risk of
        developing various cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease, high
        blood pressure, and stroke.<br><br>

        <b>Type 2 diabetes:</b> Excess weight, especially around the waist, is a
        significant risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes. The body's
        ability to use insulin effectively is reduced in overweight individuals,
        leading to high blood sugar levels.<br><br>

        <b>Metabolic syndrome:</b> Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions
        that occur together, including high blood pressure, high blood sugar,
        abnormal cholesterol levels, and excess abdominal fat. Being overweight
        increases the risk of developing metabolic syndrome.<br><br>

        <b>Sleep apnea:</b> Obesity is a major risk factor for sleep apnea, a
        condition in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep.
        Sleep apnea can lead to daytime sleepiness, high blood pressure, and
        other health complications.<br><br>

        <b>Certain types of cancer:</b> Being overweight or obese is associated
        with an increased risk of developing several types of cancer, including
        breast, colon, endometrial, kidney, and pancreatic cancer.<br><br>

        <b>Osteoarthritis:</b> Excess weight puts additional stress on the
        joints, particularly the knees and hips, leading to the development or
        worsening of osteoarthritis. This can result in pain, stiffness, and
        reduced mobility.<br><br>

        <b>Mental health issues:</b> Overweight individuals may experience
        mental health issues such as low self-esteem, depression, and body image
        dissatisfaction, which can impact their overall well-being.<br><br>

        <p><i style="color: rgb(59, 59, 59);">It's important to note that these
            risks can vary based on individual factors such as genetics,
            lifestyle, and overall health. Maintaining a healthy weight through
            a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and lifestyle
            modifications can help reduce the risks associated with being
            overweight.</i></p>

      <h3>Limitations of BMI</h3>
      <p>
        While BMI is widely used and valuable in assessing healthy body weight,
        it does come with certain limitations. BMI is an estimation that doesn't
        account for body composition. Factors such as muscle, bone mass, and fat
        distribution vary among individuals, making it important to consider
        other measurements alongside BMI when determining a person's healthy
        body weight.<br><br>

        In adults, BMI may not provide complete accuracy as it measures overall
        body weight rather than distinguishing between excess body fat and other
        components. Age, sex, ethnicity, muscle mass, body fat, and activity
        level are factors that influence BMI. For instance, an older individual
        who appears to have a healthy weight may have considerable excess body
        fat despite not being heavy due to a sedentary lifestyle. On the other
        hand, a younger person with a higher muscle composition at the same BMI
        would be considered healthy. Athletes, especially bodybuilders, may have
        higher BMIs due to their significant muscle mass despite being
        categorized as overweight. According to the CDC:<br>

        <ul><p>
            <li> Older adults tend to have more body fat than younger adults
              with the same BMI.</li>
            <li>Women generally have more body fat than men at an equivalent
              BMI.</li>
            <li> Muscular individuals and highly trained athletes may have
              higher BMIs due to their substantial muscle mass.</li></p>
        </ul>

        <p>Similar limitations apply to BMI calculations for children and
          adolescents. Factors like height and sexual maturation can influence
          BMI and body fat in this population. BMI is a better indicator of
          excess body fat for obese children, while for overweight children,
          their BMI could be influenced by increased levels of fat or fat-free
          mass (including water, organs, muscle, etc.). In thin children, the
          difference in BMI can also be attributed to fat-free mass.</p>

        <p>However, it's worth noting that BMI is reasonably indicative of body
          fat for approximately 90-95% of the population and can be used in
          conjunction with other measures to determine a person's healthy body
          weight effectively.</p>
      </p>

    <div class="notes">
      <h3>BMI formula</h3>
      <p>
        <b>USC Units</b><br><br>
        In simple terms, the formula for calculating BMI in USC units using
        pounds (lbs) and inches (in) is:<br><br>

        BMI = (weight in lbs) * 703 / (height in inches)^2<br><br>

        You can calculate the BMI by multiplying the weight in pounds by 703 and
        then dividing that by the square of the height in inches.<br><br>

        <b>SI, Metric Units</b><br><br>

        In simple terms, the BMI formula using metric units can be expressed
        as:<br><br>

        BMI = (mass in kg) / (height in meters)^2<br><br>

        Let's use an example where the person's weight is 72.57 kg and their
        height is 1.782 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we can
        calculate their BMI:<br><br>

        BMI = 72.57 / (1.782^2)
        = 72.57 / 3.174
        = 22.90

        Therefore, the BMI for a person weighing 72.57 kg and measuring 1.782
        meters in height is approximately 22.90 kg/m².
